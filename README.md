# What I've learned
This was my first time creating something in css, and first time using figma. 
I've learned about css-variables, and hopefully a little about best practices in css.  

I tried to recreate the desing as closely as possible with through the use of the figma files, althrough I found figma to be a bit challenging. 


There wasn't any fonts in the code so I just made it sans-serif style. 
In general, I think working with fonts is a bit difficult as well.
